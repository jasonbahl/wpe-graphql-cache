This plugin is used to optimize the caching experience of graphql GET requests to the WP site at WP Engine's hosted WordPress product.

Works with Apollo Persisted Queries JavaScript client.

== Description ==

Optimized your wp-graphql requests and Javascript client by using GET for your graphql requests to the WP. At WP Engine, these requests will be optimized in WP Engine's EverCache environment.

This plugin integrates with the wp-graphql-labs caching extension plugin to correctly invalidate cached data when it changes in your plugin.
